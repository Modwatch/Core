  <p class="post-body">
    Modwatch is a site for uploading and sharing modlists for Skyrim (and eventually other games). If you want to view some of the 1000+ modlists, you can look through the dropdown to the right. Or if you have one in mind, you can view it at modwat.ch/u/username.

    If you want to upload your own modlist, you can download the uploader via the gigantic orange button at the top of the page. Instructions for uploading are detailed on the nexus page.

	</div>
  <p class="post-body">
    The site menu has gotten a bit of a redesign. It now hides behind a hamburger menu (shudder), and can be toggled to stay displayed or hidden. The only funcionality change is the profile page has been replaced with a Settings page. For now all it does is change passwords, but it will get more features as I implement them. Let me know how you feel about the new menu, good or bad!
